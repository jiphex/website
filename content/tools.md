Some links to tools that I've made.

I've got a few websites/pages available online which might be useful/interesting:

- [Systemd Params by Version](/systemd) is a page which lists systemd parameters
  (which may be configured in systemd unitfiles) by their _systemd versions_,
  which the official documentation doesn't list. This is useful if you deal with
  writing Unitfiles for a range of Operating Systems, as some options aren't
  always available if the version of systemd isn't the newest.
- [uuid.me.uk](https://uuid.me.uk) is for generating UUIDs when you can't be
  faffed to `cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/uuid` (or when you just have curl)
- [ramatola.uk](https://ramatola.uk) generates mediocre passwords in a way that
  they can easily be copied/cURLed to other places
- [distro.re](https://distro.re) is a table of Linux distributions and their
  "end of life" dates. Sadly I don't keep it updated any more. Patches welcome.

If you have any suggestions or issues with any of these, please [email me](mailto:tools@james.jph.im).
