The current state of the shed is as follows:

# Electrics/connectivity

The shed is wired for sockets and has an electric heater on the wall, but isn't connected to the house wiring. At some point the connection to the house has been purposefully broken for unknown reasons (possibly this occurred during the kitchen extension and was never reconnected).

The previous owner mentioned in an e-mail that the cable to the house runs "along the path", but that's all I know. I reckon we'll need to run a new armoured cable to the house and find out how to connect it to the shed somewhere. I'll need to find an electrician and I guess run an armoured cable myself.

I should think about network connectivity to the house too - it'd be easy to run an armoured ethernet cable alongside a new mains cable and it'd be far less than the ethernet limit of 100m so CAT6 should be fine. It's probably a bit too far for a decent WiFi connection. I suppose I could run fibre, but that sounds complicated, and I'd need media converters at both ends.

# Roof

On basic inspection, the roof seems fine. The exterior felt looks pretty good and there's no sign of damp inside. The inside needs cleaning.

# External walls & windows

Both the windows are wooden, double glazed units. Both are rotten, and the glass is broken on one of them - so I think we'll need new units for both. I'll need to measure and order them, and I guess work out how to fit windows.

# Interior walls & insulation

The interior walls are painted a fetching shade of orange
