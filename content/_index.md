A blog about hosting a modern Cloud application, as a hobbyist, from a
professional perspective.

Along the way, I'll learn about things like [Terraform][terraform], lots of
[AWS][aws] services, doing Linux the "right" way with [NixOS][nixos], and
possibly about some other clouds. We might even throw some [Kubernetes][k8s]
into the mix, later on in the series.

Start reading [here](/sshshare/introducing-sshshare), where we'll learn about
the simple app we're hosting.

[aws]: https://aws.amazon.com
[terraform]: https://terraform.io
[nixos]: https://nixos.org
[k8s]: https://kubernetes.io
